# ---------- #
#
# Boom action class that holds all the variables needed to define a unique boom.
#
# It requires the coordinates of the tile to boom.

# ------------- #
#

# GET_ALL_STATES FUNCTION #
# ----------------------- #
#
# Helper function that finds all the possible states that can be created from

# --------------------- #
#
# Helper function that applies the given action without altering the player
